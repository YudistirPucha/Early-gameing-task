# Early-gaming-task
Early program on classic noughts and crosses game during first year at uni  
This was one of my first even major coding task at university and it was to creat the classical noughts and crosses game  
Prgram uses a "random" generating coordinate method to simulate an AI (machine) vs human aspect.

Again this was a task to improve my coding skills
