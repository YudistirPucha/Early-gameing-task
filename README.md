# Early-gaming-task
Early program on classic noughts and crosses game during first year at uni  
This was one of my first even major coding task at university and it was to creat the classical noughts and crosses game  
Prgram uses a "random" generating coordinate method to simulate an AI (machine) vs human aspect.

Again this was a task to improve my coding skills 

PROBLEMS: 1) human can not start the game  
	2) remove prompt after each move is taken, very annoying (COMPLETED!) 
	3)prompt on what sign you are needs to be more user friendly  
	4)AI does not "think" about its move i.e if it has a winning move, it does not take it
